Project Name:
Responsive Local Time Display

Project Description:
I developed a responsive local time display web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application showcases the current local time in an aesthetically pleasing and easy-to-read format. Key features of this project include:

Dynamic Time Display: Utilizes JavaScript to continuously update and display the local time.
Responsive Design: Ensures that the application is visually appealing and functional across various device sizes and resolutions.
Flexbox Layout: Implements Flexbox for efficient and flexible layout management, ensuring that elements are properly aligned and centered within the viewport.
Viewport Height Utilization: The design leverages viewport height units to maintain proportional element sizes relative to the screen size, enhancing the user experience.
Minimalist and Modern UI: Adopts a clean and modern user interface, with a focus on readability and user engagement.
